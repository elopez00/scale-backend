# Scale Backend

## Intro
This is the backend for the soon to be mobile application - Scale. A fintech application that I am making for fun.
I just decided one day that I disliked mint and ever since I've dedicated myself to making this application with
languages and technology I've never used before.

## Stack
For this application I will be using:
- **Docker:** This will be my delivery and packaging software
- **Go/Mux:** I will be devloping the server using golang with mux to make my life a lil easier
- **MySQL:** Will be my database solution because I want fast relational stored data

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to make a better Mint for my personal use. I am trying to take more control in
my financial life, but Mint is too smart. It literally does everything for me without asking me, and I don't like 
this. I don't like that it neatly organizes all my finances into a bunch of categories that aren't relevant to me.
I hate that I can't customize the way things are displayed. I also feel like a lot of the features are missing 
cosidering this is the end all be all solution for personal finances.

## Proposed Solution
Scale is a personal finance application with powerful budgeting features and smart balance calculations so that
the user will always be on top of their debt and financial goals.

## Features
The features that will be present in this application are mostly defined by:
- **Stickering:** The ability to label costs by their company name and relate them to categories
- **Categorization:** Custom categorization will allow the user to choose how the automatically sort incoming costs
- **SmartBalance:** Smart Balancing will subtract the scheduled payments according to dates for accurate balances
- **Notifications:** User will be notified with specific messages when costs exceed category budgets
- **User Onboarding:** Will be able to log in users whenever pretty much

## Goals
My goals personal goals for the development of this application are:
- Push every weekday starting 5/16/2021
- Learn how to create RESTful API with golang, mux, and MySQL
- Learn how to deploy projects with Docker
- Learn how to practically code in golang lol
- Learn how to effectively user MySQL

## Instructions
TBD

## Final thoughts
Wish me luck, this is a project I have been wanting to do for a while now :)
